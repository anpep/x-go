# x-go: A collection of generally useful Go packages

This Go library provides a central place for common packages.

Initially, contributions will be limited to packages used by [Snapd](https://github.com/snapcore/snapd), [Pebble](https://github.com/canonical/pebble) or [Chisel](https://github.com/canonical/chisel).

## Contributing

We welcome quality external contributions. We have good unit tests for much of the code, and a thorough code review process. Please note that unless it's a trivial fix, it's generally worth opening an issue to discuss before submitting a pull request.

Before you contribute a pull request you should sign the [Canonical contributor agreement](https://ubuntu.com/legal/contributors) -- it's the easiest way for you to give us permission to use your contributions.

## Have fun!

... and enjoy the rest of the year!
